#Coursework Code Samples
I have uploaded a few things I have worked on this past year in my MS CS program. Hopefully, they can serve as reference for other students or be helpful for some other reason. 

- **relationship-model.nlogo**, **relationship-model-hubnet.nlogo**: A [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) model that explores how relationships form. The user can adjust macro-level variables and observe how successful relationships, unhappy relationships and single individuals form. For more information, open the model in NetLogo and click on the Info tab.
- **one-direction-game.pl**: A simple game written in [Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) where the player's goal is to date a member of One Direction. The player visits various locations to find members and to better his/her chances at getting 1/5 to agree to a date. However, the player has only a limited amount of resources and must reach the goal before time or money runs out! 
- **viterbi.py**: An implementation of the Viterbi algorithm in Python.
- **sudoku.py**: Methods for a Sudoku solver, written in Python.
- **naive-bayes.py**: Uses the Naive Bayes algorithm and the Chi-Squared test to perform sentiment analysis on various movie reviews, written in Python.
- **basics.rkt**: A few basic functions in [Scheme/Racket](http://racket-lang.org/). 
- **garbage-collector.rkt**: An implementation of a two spcae copying collector in Scheme/Racket.
